My name is Joe Harter and I am a software developer. I normally code business applications in C#.

I wanted to practice my C++/Linux/Algorithm skills so I'm solving TopCoder problems and sharing it with the world.

Please take a look at the wiki to read my thoughts on each exercise. I would also value any and all feedback on my code.
