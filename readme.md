My name is Joe Harter and I am a software developer. I normally code business applications in C# so my algorithm skills are very rusty. I'm using the TopCoder challenges to practice and I'd like to share these attempts with the world.

Please take a look at the wiki to read my thoughts on each exercise. I would also value any and all feedback on my code.
